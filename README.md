# About
A basic Django quiz app with SQLite as the database. It has an admin site and a client side.

# Pre-requisite
You should have Python, Django and git installed in your machine.

# Setup And Deployment
1. To Get Started, fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repo from your account using:

`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-first-blog.git`

3. Open a new window of the terminal and change the directory to client:

`python manage.py runserver`

4. Now the server would have started at port 8000 and the browser would have rendered it.

Feel free to explore the features and implement new features.
