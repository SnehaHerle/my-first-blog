My first Django app

# About
A basic Django quiz app with SQLite as the database. It has an admin site and a client side.

# Pre-requisite
You should have Python and git installed in your machine.

# Setup And Deployment
1. To Get Started, Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

1. Clone the forked repo from your account using:

`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-first-blog.git`

1. Open terminal and execute in the main directory of the project to start the Node server at port 5000:

npm install
npm start

1. Open a new window of the terminal and change the directory to client:

cd client
cd npm start

1. Now the react server would have started at port 3000 and the browser would have rendered it.

Feel free to explore the features and implement new features.
